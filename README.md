## About
This is the official website for pamaxie. We use it kind of like a management interface, other users can use it to sign up for our public api and use it (free for non-commercial users). This allows them to manage their individual applications (and API tokens) and their account with us and how they receive news and updates about our project.

We are developing this as an open website which basically can be "looked behind" by everyone, so they can see and maybe even get inspired by its source code (or help fix issues with it if they feel like it). The website consists of components and is written in Angular. It directly accesses our API.
We do not recommend using this website for configuration related to Pamaxie, we will develop a smaller, more practical website that can serve as a management interface for pamaxie to prevent people from having to host unnecessary components in the future (we will link it here once we have something to show)
