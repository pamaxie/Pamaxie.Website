# Pamaxie.Website
### We have started development again. This is a long process and will take a while to get rolling. For now we will focus mostly on our web presence to drive more traffic to the project.

## About
This is the official website for pamaxie. We are currently undergoing a framework change to make it more accessible and easier to program for since angular with MVM wasn't too acessible for most people. We are changing to Next.JS (meaning a change to React will happen). This also means we will start completely from scratch and this will be our primary focus in the near future to ensure product representation exist and people can test the product before deploying it themselves.

We are also working on a major rewrite to allow for things like blogposts and make certain things a bit clearer since we want to change the direction a bit since we last worked on Pamaxie (We wanna make it easily accessible and self hostable and potentially make a "box").
