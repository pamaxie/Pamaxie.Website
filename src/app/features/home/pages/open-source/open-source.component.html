    <h1>Building an accepting space</h1>
    <p>Our open source philosophy is build around creating an accepting space. This means no matter how much experience
      you have, no matter who you work for you are welcome. We also enforce strict policies against discriminating
      against racial or sexual minorities.
      <br>
      We believe everyone can contribute someone important to the project but we can only achieve that by offering an
      accepting and welcoming space to people no matter their background, history or origin.
      <br>
      All of us have to follow this <a>code of conduct</a> and have to agree to it. It does not matter if you’re just
      using our API or contributing to it.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Offering help to those who need it</h1>
    <p>Our communities are build to help each other out and help people grow their skills along the way. We believe we
      all have to start somewhere, so offering help and staying friendly with inexperienced people is important to us.
      <br>
      This also means we’re happy to help people who aren’t experienced with our code-base by giving introductions to it
      and explaining how most things work.
      <br><br>
      This also means we’re happy to help people inexperienced with programming if we implement more complex solutions
      in our project and explain those solutions to them.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>We all are equal</h1>
    <p>The last important point is that we are all equal. No matter if you’re part of our internal development team or
      an external developer. We are even happy to work together with other researchers and are willing to share all of
      our datasets to those who can prove they need it.
      <br><br>
      We believe data and information needs to be shared to not get lost and that everyone helping has their place in
      our team, no matter if long time contributor with thousands of lines contributed or new fresh developer without
      any experience in our project.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Build on Open Solutions</h1>
    <p>We try to build all of our APIs services on open source or at least openly accessible solutions. This ensures
      that even if someone wants to use other service providers with many of the services we use they are able to.
      <br>
      Obviously this isn’t always possible but if you think you found something we could make more accessible to
      everyone please let us know.
      <br>
      We are for inclusion no matter if you use AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, host servers yourself or just want to use
      docker containers on your own machine.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h1>Some final words</h1>

      new people who want to help us with this important mission!</p>
