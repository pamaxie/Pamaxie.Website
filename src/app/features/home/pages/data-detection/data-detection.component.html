    <h1>How we determine data types</h1>
    <p>Since it’s hard for service providers to determine data types, we offer service endpoints to do it for them as
      well. This allows for in flight analysis without having to rely on data extensions. The way we determine the
      type of the data provided to us is via something called “magic numbers”. The magic numbers of file-types are
      essentially pieces of data that make files distinguishable.
      <br>
      Once we determined the magic numbers, we then put it in the processing queue for the appropriate data type.
      Which leads us to our next section onto what kind of data types we intend to support for now and which ones we
      intend to support in the future.</p>

    <h1>Supported data types now and in the future</h1>
    <p>In the initial release of Pamaxie we will primarily focus on determining the data type of images. This is to
      focus on ensuring our scanning system works reliably and well.
      <br>
      Our secondary goal from here on out would be detecting things like Videos. This is because it can build on top
      of our image detection and can work over a key-frame extraction system using something like FFMPEG.
      <br>
      Our tertiary goal would be developing detection systems and determinations for texts. We do not plan to detect
      hate-speech or anything like this. We believe dedicated solutions are better for that. We plan to detect
      potentially triggering messages (like messages talking about self harm or other topics that can make people
      uncomfortable).
      <br><br>
      Our quaternary goal will probably be working on detecting harmful files (like executables or zip files). This
      will take a longer while since we need to start building up specific research projects into researching Harmful
      files. We will not be able to replace your Anti-Virus software, but we do intend to detect the most harmful
      type’s of files that are well known to be harmful to users.</p>
