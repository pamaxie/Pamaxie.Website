    <h1>Tiers Explained:</h1>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Free Tier</p>
        <p>This tier was developed for allowing developers to enjoy our API without having to pay for it. It limits the
          user to 1000 requests per day. This allows the user to use our API in a non commercial capacity for things
          like developing their product or for small forums with no revenue.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Payed Tier</p>
        <p>This tier was developed for small to medium sized organizations who want their service to be hosted. It is
          rate limited to around 1000 requests per hour. If you require more requests, please contact us beforehand so
          we can find a solution together.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>SOON - Hybrid hosting</p>
        <p>This is a solution for developers who want to use our endpoints but prefer to use them in a capacity where we
          handle most of the things (like data storage and authentication for them), so they only have to handle their
          scanning capacity.
          <br>
          This means: We handle all your authentication, data caching and processing needs and all you need to do is
          scan images by using our scan clients.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Enterprise Hosting</p>
        <p>These are on request hosting systems if you do not know your demand. We will talk and advise you which tier
          might be best for you.
          <br>
          If you realize you exceed our daily capacity offered in the payed tier we will talk with you to expand and
          test our computational capacities if they’re able to offer the amount of data you require.
          <br>
          If not we will guide you through how to self host our product on premises to satisfy the demand you require.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Self Hosted</p>
        <p>This solution allows you to host your own instances of our API to do everything yourself. This means data
          storage, caching, handling the requests and scanning the data.
          <br>
          We usually do not recommend this due to how complex it can be to host a big API like this that has a lot of
          microservices, but we will help out community members in a reasonable capacity for free if they have questions
          about self hosting.
          <br>
          If you are an organization and want to self host, we don’t offer support for self hosted instances, except you
          choose enterprise hosting.</p>
