    <h1><span>our</span>. <span>mission</span>.</h1>
    <p>We believe that content scanning and filtering is important to anyone in this day an age. There is a lot of bad
      actors online and sadly they won’t go away easily. Sadly there isn’t a lot of good open source solutions and
      that’s why we were created. Tons of anti-virus software is closed source or does not publicize nearly enough
      research / information papers. Similar things go for image detection systems developed for content moderation.
      <br>
      We believe this is an issue that affects all of us and we should work together to build a safer, better internet
      in these regards.</p>
